# Sales Forecasting 

This project aims to built *sales forecast* webapps for Category A, Category B, Product A1, Product A2, Product B1 & Product B2


# Project Conclusion


1. Forecast Model for Sales Category A  

    - Model can define trend and seasonality in the dataset
    - Model has MAE +- 3.69. **This error is small because, *range* sales in category A is 1,100-1,767**
    - Model tends to predict sales higher than the actual value

2. Forecast Model for Sales Category B

    - Model can define trend and seasonality in the dataset
    - Model has MAE +- 194.48. **This error is small because, *range* sales in category B is 970-6,435**.
    - Model tends to predict sales higher than the actual value

3. Forecast Model for Sales Product A1

    - Model can define trend and seasonality in the dataset 
    - Model has MAE +- 7.4. **This error is small because, *range* sales in product A1 is 100-210**
    - Model tends to predict sales higher than the actual value

4. Forecast Model for Sales Product A2

    - Model can define trend and seasonality in the dataset
    - Model has MAE +- 1.73. **This error is small because, *range* sales in product A2 is 1,000-1,558**
    - Model tends to predict sales lower than the actual value

5. Forecast Model for Sales Product B1

    - Model can define seasonality of the dataset but cannot capture the trend
    - Model has MAE +- 120.9. **This error is small because, *range* sales in product B1 is 970-1,734**
    - Model tends to predict sales higher than the actual value


6. Forecast Model for Sales Product B2

    - Model can define seasonality of the dataset but cannot capture the trend
    - Model has MAE +- 118.66. **This error is small because, *range* sales in product B2 is 10-4,980**
    - Model tends to predict sales higher than the actual value
